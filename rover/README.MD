Jacob Foti and Ryan Hong 


1. Project Overview 
- We create a discord bot which uses an API to respond with pictures, as well as simple commands. 

2. Usage Guildlines 
- Users can download this Discord bot into their Discord servers
- !dog = Outputs a random picture of a dog in the API. 
- !pet = Outputs Thank you! + the username of the user who pet the dog
- !feed =  Outputs mmm yummy! 
- !translate = Translates the inputed sentence into english. Can translate from spanish and french. 
- !image = Generates an image using ChatGPT 
- !gpt = Answers any question using ChatGPT

3. Dependancies 
- Our Discord bot uses dog picture API to output pictures of a random breed of dog. 
  
4. Project Structure
- Our discord bot was made using python. We imported discord into our code, which allowed us to create a codeable discord bot. We also created many client.commands which lets us code the intended output when we enter a certain command for the discord bot. 

5. Collaboration 
- Jacob was in charge of creating the bot and coded !dog, !translate, !image, !gpt and !image. 
- Ryan was in charge of writing the README as well as coding !pet and !feed. 

6. Acknowledgement 
- We used a dog api (https://dog.ceo/api) as well as chatgpt to create images 

7. Reflection 
- There were some challenged when figuring out how to get the Discord bot to properly work. Specifically, at times the coded command wouldn't work and it took some trial and error to fix it. ChatGTP also helped us with some of these problems because it provided an easy way to solve the problem. During many of our tests, the function wouldn't work and outputted an error message, which Jacob knew how to fix most of the time. 
- From a learning perspective, I think we both learned a lot about what it actually takes to code a Discord bot. Going foward, if we ever need to know how to make a bot, we will be able to use @client.command. ChatGPT was able to help us with a lot of the coding issues we had, as well as problems with the bot itself.
