Project Overview
We create a discord bot which uses ChatGPT to act like dog.

Usage Guildlines
Users can download this Discord bot into their Discord servers, where they can tell Rover to fetch, roll over, and sit. The user can interact with rover through !fetch, !roll over, and !sit. This would show the respective animations for each move. The user can also use !stop, which would turn off Rover.

Dependancies
Our Discord bot uses ChatGPT to create the animations for each input.
